## Regression Modeling for Housing Price Prediction based on Numerical and Categorical Features

##### Domain             : Machine Learning
##### Sub-Domain         : Supervised Learning
##### Techniques         : Regression
##### Application Domain :  Real State, Housing 


### Description
1. Built regression model for predicting housing price using 79 numerical and categorical features with regression error (Mean Squared Error) of 0.000685 on a scale of 1.
2. Built pipelines for machine learning model training for reading files, creating training testing dataset, preprocessing (normalization, label encoding of categorical features), extracting features, and training and evaluation in grid search approach for multiple regression models.
3. Generated visualization and aggregated report on the performance of various models.
### Procedure:

1. Build pipelines for machine learning model training for reading file, creating training testing dataset, preprocessing 
   (normalization, label encoding of categorical features), extracting features, and training and evaluation in grid search approach for   
   mutiple regression models.
2. Preprocessing unit replaced non standard input features with default value and performed normalization, label encoding of categorical  
   features.
3. Build feature set using almost all available features.
4. Build model training pipeline for regression
5. Generate agregated report on performance for various models.
6. Visualization for different model performance.
